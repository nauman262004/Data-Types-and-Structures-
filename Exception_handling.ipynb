        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime, like Python, while compiled languages translate the entire code into machine code before execution, like C or Java. Compiled programs generally run faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling is a mechanism to manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks. It prevents the program from crashing when unexpected errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The finally block always executes, whether an exception occurs or not. It is used for cleanup actions such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Logging is used to record messages about a program’s execution. It helps developers track errors, debug issues, and monitor application behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "  - The del method is a destructor that is called when an object is about to be deleted. It’s typically used to release resources or perform cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - import brings the entire module into the program, while from ... import allows importing specific functions, classes, or variables from a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping multiple exceptions into a tuple in a single except statement.  \n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The with statement simplifies file handling by automatically managing file opening and closing. It ensures proper resource release even when an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading allows multiple threads to run within the same process and share memory, while multiprocessing uses separate processes with independent memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Logging helps monitor a program’s flow, find errors, and record important events. It is more flexible and organized than using print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management refers to automatically allocating and freeing memory. Python’s garbage collector handles this by deleting unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - The steps are: writing risky code inside a try block, catching errors using except, running code without errors in else, and cleaning up resources in finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - It helps prevent memory leaks and ensures efficient use of resources. Proper memory management keeps applications stable and improves performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The try block contains code that might cause an error, and the except block handles the error if it occurs. This prevents the program from stopping unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python’s garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python’s garbage collector automatically deletes objects that are no longer referenced. It uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to free memory.  \n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - The else block runs only if no exception occurs in the try block. It is used for code that should execute when everything goes smoothly.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - The common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. They indicate the severity or importance of logged messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork() creates a child process using the operating system, available only on Unix-like systems, while multiprocessing is a cross-platform module that allows creating and managing processes easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Closing a file ensures that all data is properly written to disk and system resources are released. It prevents data loss and resource leaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read() reads the entire file or a specific number of bytes at once, while file.readline() reads only one line from the file at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - The logging module is used to record messages that describe the program’s execution. It helps developers debug, monitor, and track application performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as creating, deleting, renaming, or checking the existence of files and directories.  \n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Challenges include handling circular references, avoiding memory leaks, and managing large objects efficiently. Developers must write optimized code to reduce unnecessary memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword followed by an exception type, for example: raise ValueError.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Multithreading allows programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance in I/O-bound applications like web servers or file handling.  "

        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - OOP is a programming approach that organizes code into objects containing data and functions. It helps make programs modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - An object is an instance of a class representing a real-world entity. It has its own data and can perform actions using its class’s methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction hides complex details and shows only the essential features. Encapsulation binds data and methods together and restricts direct access using private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, and __len__ are special built-in methods used to define object behavior and operator overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance allows a class to acquire the properties and methods of another class. It helps promote code reuse and hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means “many forms,” allowing methods with the same name to behave differently depending on the object calling them.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation is done by making variables private or protected and using getter and setter methods to access or modify them.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - A constructor is defined using the init() method and is automatically called when an object is created to initialize its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Class methods access class-level data, while static methods perform tasks without accessing class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python simulates this using default or variable arguments.  \n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - Method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method with the same name as one in its parent class to change its behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - The @property decorator allows class methods to be accessed like attributes, often used to control access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism allows different objects to use the same interface, making code flexible, extendable, and reducing duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly and contains abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses.  \n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - OOP provides modularity, reusability, scalability, and easier debugging. It models real-world systems effectively using objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "  - Class variables are shared among all objects of a class, while instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their features and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "  -  str returns a readable string for users, while repr provides a detailed representation for developers or debugging.  \n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "  - The super() function is used in a subclass to call methods or the constructor of its parent class. It helps reuse parent code and avoid rewriting logic in child classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The del method is a destructor that automatically executes when an object is about to be deleted. It’s mainly used to free resources or perform cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - A @staticmethod doesn’t access class or instance data and behaves like a regular function within the class.\n",
        "A @classmethod takes cls as the first parameter and can modify class-level attributes shared among all instances.  \n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - In inheritance, polymorphism allows a subclass to override a parent class method. When the same method name is called, the version in the child class runs, giving different behaviors for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line (e.g., obj.method1().method2()). It works when each method returns the object (self) itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - The call method allows an object to be called like a regular function. When defined, using parentheses after the object name executes the call method."
